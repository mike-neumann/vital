# vital-scoreboards

This submodule can be used to include Vital's advanced scoreboard system into your plugin.  
It provides the means of creating global and per-player based scoreboards, which can hold dynamic data.  

All scoreboards will be dynamic, and can change their value at any given time.  
When updated, the new values will automatically be displayed, without having to manually update single entries.
