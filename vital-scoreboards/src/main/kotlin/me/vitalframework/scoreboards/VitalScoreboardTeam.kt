/**
 * Represents a team within a scoreboard system, providing functionality for managing
 * players, team options, and interaction with the underlying Bukkit API.
 *
 * This class encapsulates team-related data and operations, such as adding/removing
 * players, configuring team options, and synchronizing the team's state with the server.
 *
 * Key attributes of the team include:
 * - Display name management (prefix and suffix).
 * - Configuration of friendly fire behavior and invisibility options.
 * - Integration with the Bukkit scoreboard API, ensuring consistency in team representation.
 *
 * The `VitalScoreboardTeam` is primarily used in the context of scoreboards and allows
 * for fine-grained control over team behaviors, visibility, and membership.
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new instance of a `VitalScoreboardTeam` with a specified name and associated scoreboard.
 * @param name The unique name of the team, used as an identifier.
 * @param scoreboard The scoreboard to which this team belongs.

     * - Used internally to manage and synchronize the behavior and settings of the team, including properties like
     *   friendly fire, visibility, and other configurable attributes.

     * This property is used during team updates to ensure the team's internal and external representations

     * - Managing the state and attributes of the team related to the Bukkit API.
     * - Facilitating synchronization of team configurations such as options, members, and display properties.
     * - Interacting with the Minecraft server through the Bukkit scoreboard system.
