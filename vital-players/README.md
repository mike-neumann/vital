# vital-players

This submodule can be used to include Vital's advanced player system into your plugin.  
It provides the means of managing a custom player instance to store player-specific session data on it.

Vital will manage a player instance once he joins, and terminate it, when he leaves.  
It may contain player-specific data, that can be retrieved at any given time within the plugin.
