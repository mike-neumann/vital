     * Represents a Spigot-specific implementation of the `VitalListener` interface and supports

     * This class listens for specific Spigot events such as player joining and quitting,
     * and links these events to corresponding functionality in the `VitalPlayerService` for
     * player creation and destruction.
     *
     * Feature Summary:
     * - Creates a new `VitalPlayer` instance when a player joins the server.
     * - Removes the `VitalPlayer` instance when a player disconnects.
     * - Uses reflection to dynamically resolve the `VitalPlayer` class for Spigot compatibility.
     *
     * Primary Responsibilities:
     * 1. Ensures that all player-related operations are synchronized with the `VitalPlayerService`.
     * 2. Responds to Spigot platform-specific events using annotated event handlers.
     *
     * Annotations:
     * - `@RequiresSpigot`: Indicates dependency on Spigot's API and ensures activation only within a Spigot environment.
     * - `@SpigotEventHandler`: Registers methods as listeners to Spigot-specific events with defined execution priority.
     * - `@Order`: Specifies the highest precedence for the bean ordering.
     *
     * @property playerService The service responsible for managing `VitalPlayer` instances.
     * @property vitalPlayerClassName The fully qualified class name of the `VitalPlayer` implementation.
