# vital-localization

This submodule can be used to include Vital's i18n (localization / internationalization) system.  
It provides the means of sending translated messages, or getting translated text using spring's i18n system.  

Players may hold a specific locale / language that when changed, will deliver language-specific messages.  

When using this submodule in combination with `vital-items`, 
the content / translated item names will automatically be updated, when a player's locale is changed.
