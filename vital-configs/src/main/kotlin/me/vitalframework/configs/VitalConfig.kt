/**
 * Represents an abstract configuration class that provides functionality for
 * managing configuration files. Implementations of this class are expected to
 * define configurations handled with a specific processor.
 *
 * The class features automatic initialization of configuration fields based
 * on annotations and processes configuration file loading, saving, and injecting
 * field values seamlessly.
 *
 * It uses a processor specified via the `Info` annotation to handle
 * serialization and deserialization of configuration data. The handling of
 * configuration fields is achieved through the `Property` annotation.
 *
 * Main responsibilities:
 * - Loading configuration values from a file or input stream.
 * - Saving current configuration values to a file.
 * - Dynamically injecting field values into the configuration object.
 *
 * Subclasses should annotate their implementation with the `Info` annotation
 * to provide details about the configuration such as its name and the processor
 * used. Fields within the configuration can be annotated with the `Property`
 * annotation to indicate they should be handled as part of the configuration.
 *
 * @constructor Initializes the configuration by loading its content from the
 *     specified file or an empty default if the file doesn't exist. Uses the
 *     processor defined in the `Info` annotation to manage the configuration
 *     file's content. If initialization fails at any point, specific exceptions
 *     are thrown with detailed error descriptions.
