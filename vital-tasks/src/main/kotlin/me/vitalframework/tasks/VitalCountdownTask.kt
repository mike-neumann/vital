/**
 * Represents a countdown task that provides customizable countdown functionality.
 *
 * This class serves as a framework for executing countdown-based logic in a controlled manner.
 * It manages the lifecycle of the countdown, including operations such as starting, stopping,
 * and resetting the countdown, as well as handling events that occur on each tick, task expiration,
 * and various lifecycle transitions.
 *
 * The class provides the following configurable behaviors:
 * - Custom logic for task lifecycle events, such as onStart, onStop, onTick, onExpire, etc.
 * - Abstract methods to define specific runnable and task implementations.
 * - Methods to control the state of the countdown task, including start, stop, reset, and restart.
 *
 * Subclasses are expected to provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods to define
 * the specific execution behavior and lifecycle management of the countdown task.
 *
 * @param T The type of the task that executes the countdown.
 * @param R The type of the runnable associated with the countdown process.
