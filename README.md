# 🚀 Vital - The ultimate plugin framework

Vital is the ultimate Minecraft server plugin framework.  
Delivering fast, easy-to-use, and powerful features, centralized so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

# ✨ Highlights

- **🧹 No `plugin.yml` anymore!**  
  Vital takes care of all the annoying `plugin.yml` configuration stuff for you.  
  Just write your code and let Vital do the rest.


- **🖥️ Advanced command system**  
  Delivering an advanced command creation system built using annotations instead of juggling strings around.  
  Define function-based command handling with advanced exception handling and **automatic tab completion** right out of
  the box!


- **📄 Advanced config system**  
  Tired of writing non-typed, verbose and error-prone config files?  
  Vital takes care of all the hassle for you.  
  Just write your config **classes** and let Vital do the rest.  
  No more loose config files, no more typos, no more errors.  
  Use classes instead of strings!


- **🧮 Easy-to-use scoreboard system**  
  Utilize an easy-to-use scoreboard creation system to track static or even player-based dynamic data!.  
  No more multi-line scoreboard creation, create one with a **single line of code!**


- **🧰 Utilities, even for non-Vital projects!**  
  Vital provides a wide range of utilities, even for projects that don't use Vital.  
  Extension functions for creating adventure components.  
  Sending formatted messages (MiniMessage) or titles.  
  Designed to reduce boilerplate code.


- **🌍 Localization**  
  Built-in support for localization using spring boot's message system.  
  Works in inventories and even **items** that are **inside-of a player's inventory**, without having to manually update
  anything!


- **🗡️ Interactive items**  
  Write class-based interactive items, with a simple and **easy-to-use API**.  
  Create items that can be interacted with, even with a **cooldown** and **native localization support!**


- **🏢 Enterprise ready**  
  With spring boot at its core, Vital is designed to be enterprise ready.  
  Built with developer usability in mind, Vital is the perfect solution for small to massive plugin projects.


- **💻 Multi-Platform support**  
  Vital supports Spigot, Paper and BungeeCord (and more to come) right out of the box,
  making it the perfect solution for your next project.


- **📦 Module system**  
  It's modular, meaning you may only include the stuff you actually need.
  Only need the base functionality? No problem, just leave it as is.  
  Need a reactive inventory system? Go ahead and include it.  
  Want everything Vital has to offer? Go for it, include every module.
  This approach decreases jar size and makes your plugin easier to maintain.

- **🔌 Plug-and-play**  
  Vital is designed to work right out of the box, no hidden configuration steps needed.  
  Just drop it in your plugin and start developing.
