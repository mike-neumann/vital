# vital-inventories

This submodule can be used to include Vital's advanced inventory menu system into your plugin.  
It provides the means of defining global inventories, which can hold data not tied to a specific player, 
as well as inventories, that may hold player-specific data and paged inventories.

Inventories are classes, that define the general structure and content of the inventory.  
As well as event handlers, to react to user input, e.g. open inventory, click on item, close inventory, change page, etc.
