# vital-loader

This submodule contains the internal logic to make a Vital plugin possible.  
It is responsible for defining a Minecraft Server-Plugin-Ready environment, that eventually will boot up a Vital instance.  

This submodule should be never be manually included into your plugin, as it is managed by Vital.
