# Vital-Initializer

This project contains the Vital-Initializer.  
It can be used to generate a fully working plugin that contains Vital.  
You can customize your plugin within the generator's setup-steps.  

After running the initializer, you can just move the generated plugin into your preferred location and then compile it.  
The generated plugin will already work as-is, so you can just throw it on a server to test it.

## How to run

1. Clone this Git repository.
2. If you're using IntelliJ, execute the `initializer` run-configuration.
3. If you're **_not_** using IntelliJ, execute either `initializer.sh` if you're on Linux or macOS, or `initializer.bat` if you're on Windows.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
