# vital-core

This submodule contains the core components and functionality of the Vital-Framework.  
Every other submodule will base upon this submodule to expand Vital's functionality.  

This submodule must be used in combination with `vital-core-processor`.  
Make sure you add the `vital-core-processor` submodule as an annotation processor, 
otherwise Vital will not automatically generate the `plugin.yml` for you.

To create a plugin with Vital, this is all you need.  
You might want to check out some of the Vital-Official submodules to expand functionality though.
