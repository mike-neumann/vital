# Template for new Vital plugins

This project is a template for new Vital plugins.  
It gives you a good starting point for new plugins you plan to create with Vital.  

Just follow these easy steps to get started:
1. Copy the `template` directory into your project's directory.
2. Rename the directory to your plugin's name.
3. Choose your desired programming language by following the TODOs in the codebase.
4. Done!

Now you can build your plugin and throw it on a server.  
Simply build it by running `./gradlew build` or `gradlew.bat build` if you're under Windows in the project's directory.  
The plugin JAR will be located in `build/libs/plugin-name.jar`.  

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, you can also use the preconfigured run configurations `build` to build your plugin!
