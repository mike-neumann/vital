/**
 * Represents a customizable item with unique metadata and behavior within the Vital framework.
 *
 * This class provides a base structure for creating items with cooldown functionality and custom
 * interactions. It includes handling for left-click, right-click, and cooldown-specific events.
 *
 * Classes inheriting from `VitalItem` must be annotated with `@Info` to define the itemâ€™s metadata,
 * such as its type, name, lore, amount, and other properties.
 *
 * The class also ensures that each item is uniquely identifiable through its persistent data container.
