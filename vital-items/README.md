# vital-items

This submodule can be used to include Vital's advanced item system into your plugin.  
It provides the means of defining items, that can be interacted with.  

Items are classes, that define the general structure and content of the item.  
As well as event handlers, to react to user input, e.g. left-click, right-click, cooldown, etc.
